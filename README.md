Q:How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
      A: I can ensure that my code or software is functional and secure by first and foremost testing it thoroughly.  By testing this as much as possible I can ensure the utmost functionality of my code in order to provide the highest quality deliverable possible.  I can make sure that it is secure by placing it in private repositories and only allowing access to those I trust completely with the code itself.
      
Q: How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
A: I interpret user needs by asking clarifying questions.  The best practice is to not need to assume anything when it comes to what the users need out of the program.  When I fully understand what is needed, utilizing coding best practices I can create pseudocode in order to give myself an outline as I work to make sure I cover every point needed.

Q: How do I approach designing software?
A: I approach designing software like you would approach cooking a nice meal.  Start by asking, what do you want to make? Then once you know what dish you are going to make you gather the required ingredients to make that meal. As you formulate your dish and begin cooking it is always good to taste test along the way to make sure you aren't missing anything and it meets all your expectations along the way.
